# Creating a Simple Chatbot Using LangChain and Llama 2

This project demonstrates how to build a simple chatbot using the LangChain framework and the Llama 2 model. LangChain provides tools to structure and simplify the process of building applications with language models, while Llama 2, a cutting-edge large language model, serves as the core engine for generating intelligent responses.

## Features

- **Natural Language Understanding**: Uses Llama 2 for generating responses to user inputs.
- **Integration with LangChain**: Simplifies chatbot development and supports advanced functionalities like chaining prompts and memory management.
- **Customizable Behavior**: Modify the prompts and logic to suit various use cases, such as FAQs, virtual assistants, or educational bots.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

1. Python 3.8 or higher installed.
2. Access to Llama 2 model API or a locally hosted Llama 2 instance.
3. Required Python libraries installed.
4. Basic knowledge of Python and natural language processing concepts.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/saransathish/Creating-Simple-Chatbot-Using-Langchain-and-llama2-model.git
   cd Creating-Simple-Chatbot-Using-Langchain-and-llama2-model
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install langchain-community
   pip install langchain_core
   pip install streamlit
   ```

3. (Optional) If running Llama 2 locally, configure the necessary hardware and dependencies as per the model documentation.

## Usage

1. Run the chatbot application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run chatbot.py
   ```

2. Interact with the chatbot in the terminal by typing messages. The chatbot will respond intelligently based on the Llama 2 model and the LangChain framework.

3. To customize the chatbot's behavior, edit the `chatbot.py` file:
   - Modify prompts to change the bot's personality.
   - Adjust the chain logic for different conversational flows.

## Key Components

- **LangChain Framework**: Enables chaining prompts, memory handling, and context-aware conversations.
- **Llama 2 Model**: Provides the language generation capabilities.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Defines the behavior and tone of the chatbot by customizing input prompts.

## Customization

- **Prompt Customization**: Modify the `initial_prompt` in `chatbot.py` to change the chatbot's behavior.
- **Add Memory**: Use LangChain's memory module to enable the chatbot to recall previous interactions.
- **Integration**: Extend the chatbot by integrating APIs or databases to enhance functionality.

## Example Interaction

```plaintext
User: Hello, chatbot!
Chatbot: Hello! How can I assist you today?

User: What is LangChain?
Chatbot: LangChain is a framework for building applications powered by language models. It enables developers to chain prompts, handle memory, and manage inputs/outputs effectively.
